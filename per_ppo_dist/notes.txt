things that need to change:

-buffer shape needs to be adjusted to be not (n_envs, steps) but rather just (steps)
---need to test/adjust advantage calculation with this
---need to check if anything else relies on the n_envs part, things that might be a safety check or whatnot

-need to create a worker that sends data and updates models
---how to send model data to be updated?
---needs to send rollout data once an episode is deemed completed which should be based on the terminal observation?
---custom buffer?

-work out what is the best way to transmit data across network
---redis for now? since it is "known" software but can be updated or made custom later after testing

-how to deal with reward/etc. logging
